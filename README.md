The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the html skills I have obtained from completeing the Odin Project lessons.

It demonstrates my ability to generate html boilerplate and generate a human readable title for the site's browser tab.

The project also demonstrates my knowledge of generating content within the body element of html code. In particular, it shows my knowledge of how to create headings and subheadings to organize content on the page, generate relative hyperlinks to different pages on the website, insert images into webpages, and make appropriate use of ordered and unordered lists.

Lastly, the project demonstrates my competency with Linux OS, git, github, and operating the command line. It showcases my ability to appropriately implement git commits with stylistically correct commit messages and to produce all of this content within Linux OS, utilizing command line interface functions.
